# `CLAUDE.md` — the per-project rules file (mobile)

> **What this is.** [AGENT-CONTEXT.md](AGENT-CONTEXT.md) is how I work in general — it lives in Notion
> and I paste it into a chat. **This** lives in the repo, committed at the root, and is read
> automatically every session. ⭐⭐ **Use both.**

**Setup:** `/init` for a first draft, then replace with the template below and fill the brackets.

## The template — copy from here

```md
# Project: <name>

## What this is
<One sentence: who uses it and for what.>
<One sentence: what it must never do.>

## Platform constraints — these drive every decision
- ⭐ We CANNOT hotfix. A store review is 1–3 days. OTA (EAS Update) only
  fixes JavaScript — never native code, permissions, or app config.
- ⭐ Old app versions never die. Every API change is additive.
  NEVER a breaking change.
- The network is hostile. Offline is a designed state, not an error.
- The OS kills the app in the background without warning.
- ⭐ The bundle is public. There are NO secrets in this app.

## Stack — do not substitute without asking
- Expo (React Native) + TypeScript, Expo Router
- <TanStack Query with persistence> for server state
- expo-secure-store for tokens. <MMKV / AsyncStorage> for non-sensitive.
- <Supabase / our API> backend
- <Store IAP for digital goods | Stripe for physical goods>
- Sentry with native symbolication
- EAS Build + EAS Update
- Package manager: <pnpm>

## Commands
- Dev client: <pnpm start --dev-client>
- Typecheck / lint / test: <pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test>
- Build: <eas build --profile preview>

## ⭐⭐ Before adding ANY library
- Say whether it requires native code. If it does, STOP and tell me —
  that ends OTA for this change and costs a store review.
- Prefer Expo SDK modules over third-party native modules.

## Conventions
- Files kebab-case. Components PascalCase.
- Server state via TanStack Query. Never fetch-in-useEffect by hand.
- All API input validated with Zod at the boundary.
- Dates stored UTC, formatted at render.
- Money as integers in the smallest unit. Never floats.
- Every screen has loading, error, empty and offline states.
  Empty is two states: never-had-any, and filtered-to-zero.
- Lists use FlashList/FlatList. Never .map() over a long list.

## Design rules
- Respect platform conventions. Do not force iOS patterns onto Android.
- SafeAreaView / useSafeAreaInsets on every screen.
- Tap targets ≥ 44pt iOS / 48dp Android.
- Test every form with the keyboard open.
- Never ship placeholder text or fake people.

## Security rules — non-negotiable
- Tokens in expo-secure-store. NEVER AsyncStorage — it is plain text.
- ⭐ No secrets in the bundle. If a call needs a key, the app calls our
  API and our API holds it.
- Every DB query filters by the authenticated user, server-side.
- RLS on and forced.
- Permissions asked at point of use, with a reason. The screen must
  still work if denied.
- Uploads: validate content, cap size, strip EXIF.
- Never log PII — crash reports leave the device.
- Logout clears secure store, cache, query cache and files.
- Deep links are untrusted input. Validate them.

## Network & battery rules — non-negotiable
- ⭐ NO API call in render(). Ever.
- Every useEffect that fetches: correct primitive deps, cleanup returned.
- Every listener removed: AppState, NetInfo, keyboard, navigation.
- Retries max 3, exponential backoff with jitter, never 4xx except 429.
- ⭐ No background polling. Push notifications instead.
- Every request has a timeout.
- Offline writes queue and are idempotent.
- No large download on cellular without asking.

## Do NOT
- Do not add a dependency without naming it, why, and whether it
  needs native code.
- Do not run migrations, `git push`, `git reset --hard`, `git rebase`,
  or any store submission.
- Do not touch app.json, eas.json, .env, or the native folders
  without asking.
- Do not refactor files I did not ask you to change.
- Do not delete tests or weaken assertions to go green.
- ⭐ Do not claim something is tested if you only ran the simulator.
  Say "simulator only".
- Do not implement iOS only. Android is half the job.
- Do not agree with me if I ask for something that will leak data,
  drain battery, or get rejected. Say so first.

## ⭐⭐ How we build — the phase protocol
When I say "build the next phase of app", this is what it means:
1. Read BUILD-PLAN.md. Find the FIRST phase not marked DONE.
2. Tell me which phase it is, its GOAL, and its DONE WHEN. Then build it.
3. Read the edge cases that phase owns before writing code.
4. If the phase says PLAN MODE: yes — plan it and STOP for approval.
5. ⭐ If the plan is now wrong or out of date, say so BEFORE building.
   Do not build the wrong thing correctly.
6. Stay inside the phase. Do not build ahead.
7. When finished: mark the phase DONE in BUILD-PLAN.md and rewrite its
   CURRENT STATE section. ⭐⭐ THIS IS HOW THE NEXT SESSION KNOWS WHERE
   IT IS — never skip it.
8. Then tell me: what changed · what to look at · what worried you ·
   real device or simulator only · what the next phase is. Then stop.
⭐ A phase is DONE when its DONE WHEN test passes — not when the code
  exists.

## ⭐ Every third phase — the document check
Before starting, re-read PRD.md and TRD.md and tell me:
- what we have built that CONTRADICTS them
- what decision we changed but never wrote down
- which sections are now wrong
⭐⭐ A stale document is followed confidently. That is worse than no
  document. Fix them before continuing, or tell me to.

## Plan first when
- The change touches auth, payments, or user data.
- ⭐ ANYTHING adds native code, touches permissions, or changes
  app.json / eas.json.
- The change spans more than three files, or changes the schema.
- The API contract changes (old versions never die).
- The request is vague.

## Before you finish any task
1. Run <pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test>.
2. Tell me what changed and what to look at.
3. Say whether you ran it on a device, and which one.
4. Say what happens offline, and what happens if the OS kills the app.
5. Flag anything risky you saw but did not change.
```

## Keeping it honest

| ⭐ Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| **Update it when a convention changes** | ⭐⭐ A stale rule is followed confidently — worse than no rule |
| **Keep it under ~140 lines** | It is read every session |
| ⭐⭐ **The native-code question earns its place** | It is the one rule that protects your ability to ship a fix in five minutes |
| **Every rule should have cost you something once** | If you cannot remember why, delete it |

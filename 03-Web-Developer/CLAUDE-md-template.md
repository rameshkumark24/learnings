# `CLAUDE.md` — the per-project rules file

> **What this is.** [AGENT-CONTEXT.md](AGENT-CONTEXT.md) is how I work *in general* — it lives in
> Notion and I paste it into a chat. **This** is the file that lives *in the repo*, committed at the
> root, so the agent reads it automatically every session without me pasting anything.
>
> ⭐⭐ **Both. Not one or the other.** The Notion file carries the rules between projects; this file
> carries the specifics of *this* project.

**Setup:** run `/init` to generate a first draft from the codebase, then replace it with the template
below and fill in the angle brackets. Commit it. Update it whenever a convention changes — a stale
`CLAUDE.md` is worse than none, because the agent follows it confidently.

## The template — copy from here

```md
# Project: <name>

## What this is
<One sentence: who uses it, and for what.>
<One sentence: what it must never do — lose an order, double-charge, expose a document.>

## Stack — do not substitute without asking
- <Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind>
- UI: shadcn/ui as the base. reactbits.dev for motion pieces only.
- <Supabase (Postgres + Storage), Clerk (auth), Stripe (payments)>
- <Upstash Redis (rate limiting), Sentry (errors), Vercel (hosting)>
- Package manager: <pnpm>

## Folder structure
<paste your actual tree — 15 lines is enough>

## Commands
- Dev: <pnpm dev>
- Typecheck / lint / test: <pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test>
- Build: <pnpm build>

## Conventions
- Files kebab-case. Components PascalCase. Functions camelCase.
- Server Components by default; 'use client' only where interaction requires it,
  and pushed as far down the tree as possible.
- Server state via TanStack Query. Never hand-roll fetch-in-useEffect.
- All API input validated with Zod at the boundary.
- All errors returned as { error: { code, message } }.
- Dates stored UTC, formatted only at render.
- Money as integers in the smallest unit. Never floats.
- Every list has a loading, error, empty and success state. Empty is two
  states: never-had-any, and filtered-to-zero.

## Design rules
- shadcn components are owned and editable — edit them, don't wrap them in
  three layers.
- ONE accent colour: <#______>. Everything else is the neutral ramp.
- No gradient backgrounds. No glassmorphism. No emoji as icons — lucide,
  20px, stroke 1.5.
- Motion is deliberate: at most <one> reactbits effect per page, on the
  element that deserves attention.
- Never ship placeholder text. If you don't have copy, ask me for it.

## Security rules — non-negotiable
- Every DB query filters by the authenticated user's ID, server-side.
- Never put an authorization decision in the browser.
- RLS is ON and FORCED. The app filter and RLS are two layers, not one.
- Never spread req.body into an ORM call — whitelist fields explicitly.
- Never return a whole DB row. Return an explicit shape.
- Never add NEXT_PUBLIC_ to anything secret.
- Never use the service_role key in client code.
- Verify the Stripe webhook signature before processing any event.
- Never write PII to logs or Sentry.
- Uploads: validate magic bytes not extension, cap size, strip EXIF.

## API call rules — non-negotiable
- Every useEffect that fetches has a correct primitive dependency array.
- Every fetch gets an AbortController and a <10>s timeout.
- Retries: max 3, exponential backoff with jitter, never retry 4xx except 429.
- Debounce search inputs at 400ms, minimum 2 characters.
- Every new endpoint gets a rate limit before it is merged.
- Any agent/LLM loop has an explicit MAX_STEPS constant.
- Never introduce setInterval without a matching clearInterval.
- Payment operations carry an idempotency key.

## Do NOT
- Do not add a dependency without telling me the package name and why.
- Do not run migrations, `git push`, `git reset --hard`, or `git rebase`.
- Do not touch .env, CI config, or /infra without asking.
- Do not refactor files I did not ask you to change.
- Do not delete tests or weaken assertions to make a build pass.
- Do not invent endpoints — check <docs/api-contract.md> first.
- Do not claim something is tested if you did not run it.
- Do not agree with me if I ask for something that will leak data or
  cost money. Say so first.

## ⭐⭐ How we build — the phase protocol
When I say "build the next phase", this is what it means:
1. Read BUILD-PLAN.md. Find the FIRST phase not marked DONE.
2. Tell me which phase it is, its GOAL and its DONE WHEN. Then build it.
3. Read the edge cases that phase owns before writing code.
4. If the phase says PLAN MODE: yes — plan it and STOP for approval.
5. ⭐ If the plan is now wrong or out of date, say so BEFORE building.
   Do not build the wrong thing correctly.
6. Stay inside the phase. Do not build ahead.
7. When finished: mark the phase DONE in BUILD-PLAN.md and rewrite its
   CURRENT STATE section. ⭐⭐ THIS IS HOW THE NEXT SESSION KNOWS WHERE
   IT IS — never skip it.
8. Then tell me: what changed · what to look at · what worried you ·
   what it did to the bundle and the LCP · what the next phase is. Stop.
⭐ A phase is DONE when its DONE WHEN test passes — not when the code
  exists.

## ⭐ Every third phase — the document check
Before starting, re-read PRD.md and TRD.md and tell me:
- what we have built that CONTRADICTS them
- what decision we changed but never wrote down
- which sections are now wrong, including any ROUTE that moved
⭐⭐ A stale document is followed confidently. That is worse than no
  document. Fix them before continuing, or tell me to.

## Plan first when
- The change touches auth, payments, or user data.
- The change spans more than three files.
- There is a schema change.
- The request is vague ("make it faster", "make it scale", "fix the design").

## Before you finish any task
1. Run <pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test>.
2. Tell me what changed and what I should look at.
3. Flag anything risky you noticed but did not change.
4. If it touched auth, data, payments or uploads — say so, so I run
   /security-review and a Codex cross-check.
```

## Keeping it honest

| ⭐ Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| **Update it when a convention changes** | ⭐⭐ A stale rule is followed confidently. That is worse than no rule. |
| **Keep it under ~120 lines** | It is read every session. Bloat costs you attention on the lines that matter. |
| **Write rules as commands, not preferences** | "Never spread req.body" beats "we prefer explicit fields" |
| **Put the *why* on the dangerous ones only** | A reason makes a rule stick; a reason on every line makes none of them stick |
| ⭐⭐ **Every rule here should have cost you something once** | If you cannot remember why a line is there, delete it |
